Quantum Computer VS. Personal Computer

in this video I am talking about Games for  today's Quantum Computers and at the end playing a game between my computer and a real quantum computer.
In this project I am using a tool named Qiskit to access IBM's quantum computer.
Qiskit is an open-source software development kit  for working with quantum computers.
